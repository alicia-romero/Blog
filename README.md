# Blog

This is a Full Stack Web Application built with Spring MVC.
It uses a MySQL database (creation script is added to file),
which you first have to create and add to program with setting the password.
Also, it has a front-end, which uses TinyMCE to create the HTML of blog posts.
You need to add your own API Key in the code.

How it works?
First you have to decide, if you are an admin or a visitor.
Visitors can only read posts, and fillter them by hashtags.
Admins can create, update and delete them too.
